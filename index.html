          <p>Climate change has already begun to adversely impact our business. Critical sourcing regions for the
            agricultural products upon which we rely are increasingly subjected to extreme weather events, such as
            droughts, floods, and heatwaves. These events not only exacerbate the existing strain on agricultural
            systems, but also jeopardize sourcing strategies and impose additional costs.</p>
          <p>To address climate related risks within our agricultural supply chains, it is imperative that we increase
            climate resilience. We achieve this by working with farmers, implementation partners and suppliers to deploy
            regenerative agricultural practices that both reduce greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate future climate
            change as well as facilitate farmers’ adaptation to new climate conditions.</p>

          <p>In India, the Agronomy team used this climate information in their Positive Agriculture plan for the potato
            program. Confronted with a significant risk of extremely high water stress, the team set ambitious targets
            centered on enhancing watershed and soil health. By 2025, they aim for targeted soil testing in 69% of
            growing areas, incorporate High Efficiency Irrigation Systems in 19% of growing areas, and facilitate the
            adoption of green manure and crop rotation in 10% of the growing areas.</p>
          <p>
            In South Africa, climate risks are being considered in the development of a Positive Agriculture strategy
            through engagement with suppliers. In oats heat stress will be the primary factor limiting yields by 2030.
            Consequently, farmers in irrigated farms are recommended to adjust their planting dates and nighttime
            irrigation schedules to safeguard their crops. For rainfed farms, recommendations include the use of heat
            tolerant varieties, combined with soil health management practices.

          <p>In 2019, PepsiCo established a partnership with the <a href="https://alliancebioversityciat.org/" class="underlined xl">Alliance of Bioversity-CIAT</a> to create climate risk and opportunity intelligence specific to our business. We focused on downscaling to the geographies and timelines of relevance for business decision making, out to 2030. While relying on leading global climate data and models, this partnership combines our ambitious Positive Agriculture agenda and supply chain data with CIAT’s climate</p>
          <p>and agriculture expertise,  for a first-time deep dive into the risks and opportunities for adaptation in the face of progressive climate change. As a result of understanding the local climate impacts and business case of investing in resilience, this tool enables development of Regen Ag plans that will also increase farm and supplier resilience to climate risk. Such shared value creates opportunities for large-scale partnerships.</p>
